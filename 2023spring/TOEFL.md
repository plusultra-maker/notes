## Listening
Tips:
about the material:
- the material is about 3-4 minutes long.
- If it's a lecture with a term that shouldn't be assumed as commonly known concept, it will be defined in the lecture's beginning. Focused on the beginning and gain a general idea of the term.
  Also, be aware of the examples, or an added experiment brought up in the lecture. Find out why are the examples given, what's for.
- If it's a dialogue, it may contains a lot of details, and sometimes the topic was not mentioned in the beginning. So try to write down the key words that can break down the dialogue into several parts, and write down the key words of each part.

Always be attentive to those logical words, like but, despite, however, therefore, thus, so, as a result, consequently, in contrast, on the other hand, in addition, moreover, furthermore, nevertheless, nonetheless, etc.

about the questions and answers:

about taking notes:
- the notes should be short and concise, only key words and phrases, or even just symbols. Use abbreviations. Use arrows to connect related information.
