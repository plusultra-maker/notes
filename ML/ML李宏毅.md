## GAN
### course
- generator: 
  - input: x, z from simple distribution p(z)(z is a random variable)
  - output: y (from complex distribution p(y) in theory)
- why generator:
  - the right output (from training data) is not certain
  - the answer should be a distribution ---- creative
- input distribution: 
  - simple distribution p(z)-- normal distribution is good enough
  - the generator will learn to map z to y, which is complex
