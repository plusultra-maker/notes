# Network top-down approach

## Chapter 3: Transport Layer
- Intro
  - about principles 
  - about protocols
  - the point of transport layer
    - logical end-to-end communication between processes
  - different from network layer
    - network layer: logical communication between hosts
    - transport layer relies on network layer, that makes it possible to focus on processe s within hosts
- multiplexing/demultiplexing
  - multiplexing: handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header, pass to network layer
  - demultiplexing: use header info to deliver received segments to correct socket
  - the key is about multiple sockets, we need segment header to identify which socket (app) it belongs to
  - UDP-port 
    - just add source/destination port number to segment header
    - local seed to the server, the server send the response back to the same port (but the source/destination port number are reversed)
    - the server can handle multiple clients by and only by using different ports
  - TCP socket
    - identified by 4-tuple: source IP, source port, dest IP, dest port
    - each socket associated with a different connecting client
    - but sockets can use the same port number( eg. 80 for HTTP) , and demultiplexing is done by the 4-tuple to the correct socket (or say the TCP-connection)
- Connectionless transport:UDP
  - simple, bare bone
    - best effort service: lost , out of order
    - no handshaking between UDP sender, receiver, no connection state at all, low RTT
    - each UDP segment handled independently of others 
    - no congestion control: UDP can blast away as fast as desired
      - good for streaming multimedia apps  
      - DNS, SNMP
      - online games
      - can be fixed by application layer (HTTP/3 )
  - sender actions
