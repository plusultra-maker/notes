Writing advice for the 500-word essay
[This advice mainly concerns essays in philosophy, but much of it applies equally to the writing of other kinds of text.]
It is essential that your essay presents an argument in support of an answer to the question it addresses,
and that this argument is briefly defended against one or more possible objections.
Clarity and precision are ideals generally worth striving for. Here 'clarity' means that any intelligent
person who has never before heard about the issues you are addressing can understand your essay.
And 'precision' means that no advanced philosopher can reasonably complain that the terms of your
argument are vague or not well defined.
The following four principles may be derived from these ideals.
(1) Restrict the scope of your essay to offering just an interesting part or version of an answer to
merely an interesting part or version of the question (trying to offer a comprehensive
philosophical treatment of anything in a short essay tends to be a hopeless undertaking).
(2) Reduce the number of specialist terms to a minimum (because each one requires an explanation
when it is first introduced).
(3) Prioritise rigour-technical repetition, schematism, etc.-over beauty (for example, continue to
use the same word rather than varying it for purely aesthetic reasons).
(4) Give many examples (any claim that is not absolutely obvious should ideally be accompanied by
an example, but you do not have so many words available, so choose your examples wisely).
Improving one's philosophical writing takes time and effort. It is generally advisable to finish a first
draft early, and revise it later with at least a few days in between.
Please feel free to approach the teachers with any writing-related questions anytime. You may also
benefit from reading Michael Huemer's writing guide (https://www.owl232.net/writing.htm).

## SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY
- Importance of scientific philosophy
  - Einstein's View:
    - > Many scientists are like someone who sees trees but not the forest. Philosophy grants independence from the prejudices of one's time, which is crucial for true seekers of truth.
  - value of philosophy:
    - uncertainty
      - normal things can be problematic with deep philosophical thought
      - possiblilities
- What Philosophy Is
  - 哲学不是自然科学，但它和科学属于同一追求知识的过程。
    - why
      - Philosophical questions often exceed the scope of direct experimental verification, yet philosophy still engages in rigorous inquiry through logic and evidence.
    - deeply continuous with science?
  - 哲学是一种系统的、批判性的、基于证据的探究
  - 哲学和数学一样，缺乏统一定义，但这不是缺陷。
  - Those who offer the asking-without-answering model of philosophy have not thought hard enough about what it is to ask a question
- Philosophy has made much more progress than the [critic] realises
